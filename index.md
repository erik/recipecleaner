# RecipeCleaner

Recipe sites suck. Make them suck a little less.

Even with an ad blocker, recipe sites are a messy experience. Popups ask you to
subscribe, there are pages and pages of filler text and images to scroll
through, and then finally the recipe is tucked away at the bottom somewhere.

RecipeCleaner shows you only what you care about: what you're making, what you
need, and how to make it.
